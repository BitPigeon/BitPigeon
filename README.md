# Hi, I'm TheRealPenguin

I don't really do all to much github nowadays, but I still code sometimes.

- I enjoy coding in __python__
- I enjoy using __markdown__
- Ask me about __python__
- I am trying to start using __GitHub__ again
- Ask me to __collaborate__
- Currently looking to help people with __coding__
- Willing to learn new __languages__ or __techniques__
- Having __fun__
- I know __HTML__, __JavaScript__, __Python__, __sh__, and some __C#__
- My coding is very __sloppy__, because I am __self-taught__

Not all of my __projects__ are on __GitHub__. Please give me something to do and __invite me__ to one of your __projects__.
