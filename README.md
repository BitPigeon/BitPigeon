I am a teenager on the internet that knows how to 'code'. My favorite languages are Python, Markdown, TypeScript, and C++. I am knowledgable about language development in _all_ languages. I am currently learning SDL2 with C++. I am currently building a language in C++. My favorite language is TypeScript. I enjoy C++, but I struggle with the strict typing. Feel free to have a conversation with me at my [__main repo__](htps://github.com/BitPigeon/BitPigeon).
