# Hello World!
## I'm @desvasicek
I like to make cool stuff for python. I hope to one day make something awesome everyone uses.
### About Me
- I love to code! Coding is fun + it is a good skill to have. 
- I also love science, specifically biology. 
- I beleive everyone should have a good README for github. It is pretty much the entire explanation of your project, and if you don't have one, users will be like "Um, what do I do here???". Also it increases the popularity of your project, if it stands out. Also, if you can't make one yourself, just generate one online! There are tons of repos for that.
- I love Markdown and Python! reStructuredText is my worst enemy.
- GitHub is so useful! More people should use it!
